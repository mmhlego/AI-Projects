# AI Projects

This repository contains my artificial intelligence projects for "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" course presented by [Dr Koohestani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_xA7MDwAAAAJ&hl=en) in [University of Tabriz](https://tabrizu.ac.ir/).

## Projects List

List of available projects:

#### BFS & DFS Algorithm implementation

In this project the BFS and GBFS algorithms are implemented to have a better understanding of navigation algorithm and their time complexity.

A sample output of this project is shown below:

![sample output](./BFS%20%26%20DFS/images/result.png)

More information about this project is available in the [projects description](./BFS%20%26%20DFS/README.md).

#### A\* & GBFS Algorithm implementation

This project is visual representation of both **_A\*_** and **_GBFS_** algorithms written in javascript language and visualized using [p5.js](https://www.p5js.org) library.

![Sample path](./Astar%20%26%20GBFS/images/sample-path.png)

More information about this project is available in the [projects description](./Astar%20%26%20GBFS/README.md).

#### Genetic Algorithm - f(x) = x^2

This is the first of three projects which use [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to solve a certain problem.

In this project we try to maximize the value of the following function:

$$f(x) = x^2$$

We try to achieve this goal using **Genetic Algorithm** principles like mutation, crossover & etc and record this process.

A single generation of our programmed is shown as below:

![Sample Generation](<./f(x)%20%3D%20x2%20-%20GA/images/Generation.png>)

More information about this project is available in the [projects description](<./f(x)%20%3D%20x2%20-%20GA/README.md>).

#### Genetic Algorithm - N-queens problem

#### Genetic Algorithm - Traveling sales person
