# Genetic Algorithm - Traveling sales person

In this project we use genetic algorithm to solve the [Traveling Salesperson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) optimization problem. This is an [NP-Hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) problem and there is no polynomial answer for it. Thus we try to guess an answer and optimize it as much as possible.

Here is an image from the application:
